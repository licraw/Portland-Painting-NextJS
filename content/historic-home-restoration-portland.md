    Historic Home Restoration in Portland: Preserving Character While Upgrading Efficiency
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Portland is home to some of the Pacific Northwest’s most charming historic neighborhoods—from the Craftsman-lined streets of Irvington to the timeless Victorians in Ladd’s Addition. Restoring one of these homes is a labor of love, and it’s possible to retain their architectural integrity while improving comfort, safety, and efficiency. Here’s how to strike the right balance.

    Assess and Preserve Original Materials
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Before removing anything, document and assess what's salvageable. Original trim, baseboards, doors, and windows often just need repair—not replacement. Use gentle cleaning agents and wood consolidants to restore aging features instead of stripping them out.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Restoring Mouldings and Built-Ins
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Historic mouldings add character that's hard to replicate. If pieces are missing or damaged, work with a local millworker to reproduce profiles that match the original. For built-ins, reinforce loose joinery with wood glue and dowels rather than modern fasteners.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Repairing Versus Replacing Windows
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Old wood windows can often be re-glazed, weatherstripped, and sealed to perform nearly as well as replacements—while maintaining their vintage look. Adding interior storm panels is a great way to boost insulation without compromising aesthetics.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Upgrading Without Erasing
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    When upgrading insulation or HVAC systems, consider minimally invasive techniques like blown-in insulation or ductless heat pumps. These upgrades improve energy efficiency without requiring major alterations to the building envelope.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Work with Preservation-Minded Pros
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Portland has a thriving restoration community. Whether you're hiring for a full remodel or a small trim repair, seek out professionals experienced in working with historic properties. They’ll understand how to protect your investment—and the soul of the structure.
  </p>

    Keep Portland’s History Alive
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Restoring a historic home is more than a renovation—it's a commitment to preserving the spirit of our city. With thoughtful updates, you can enjoy modern efficiency while honoring timeless craftsmanship that’s part of Portland’s architectural legacy.
