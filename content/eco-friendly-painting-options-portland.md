    What Are Low-VOC and Zero-VOC Paints?
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are chemicals that evaporate into the air during and after painting, contributing to indoor air pollution and smog. Low-VOC and zero-VOC paints minimize or eliminate these emissions—making them safer for your health and the environment without compromising on quality or durability.
