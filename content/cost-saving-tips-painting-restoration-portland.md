    Cost-Saving Tips for Painting and Restoration Projects in Portland: Budget-Friendly Solutions
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Updating your home’s paint or restoring its original charm doesn’t have to break the bank. With the right planning and a few insider tips, Portland homeowners can cut costs without compromising on quality. Here’s how to stretch your budget while still getting beautiful, long-lasting results.

    Plan with Purpose
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Start by walking through your space and identifying what truly needs attention. Focus on high-traffic or high-visibility areas first—like entryways, trim, and exterior façades. Prioritize safety-related items (like rot repairs or flaking lead paint) before cosmetic upgrades.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Choose Materials Strategically
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li><strong>Use high-quality primer:</strong> It reduces the amount of finish coat needed and improves adhesion.</li>
    <li><strong>Buy in bulk:</strong> Many Portland paint stores offer contractor pricing or seasonal discounts on gallon purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt for mid-range tools:</strong> Don’t go cheapest—but you don’t need pro sprayers for small jobs either.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Invest in Prep, Not Just Paint
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Good prep saves you from costly touch-ups. Clean thoroughly, repair imperfections, sand, and tape cleanly. These steps can make budget paint look like a professional job—especially if you’re DIYing it.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Know When to DIY and When to Hire
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Painting interior walls? DIY is likely fine. Repainting exterior eaves three stories up? Hire a pro. For anything involving lead paint, structural repair, or significant ladder work, the cost of hiring out is usually worth it for safety and durability.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Bundle Projects for Savings
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    If you’re already hiring a contractor, bundle tasks (like siding repairs and trim painting) into one job. Most companies offer better rates when they can schedule and mobilize once instead of piecemeal.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Final Thoughts: Smart Spending Pays Off
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    You don’t need the most expensive paint or the fanciest finish to make your Portland home shine. With thoughtful planning, smart product choices, and strategic hiring, you can maximize your ROI and enjoy a refreshed space without overspending.
