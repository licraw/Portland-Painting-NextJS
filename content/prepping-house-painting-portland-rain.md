    A Homeowner’s Guide to Preparing Your House for Painting in Portland’s Rainy Seasons
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Painting your home in Portland’s wet climate can be tricky—but it’s entirely possible with the right preparation. Whether you’re tackling it yourself or hiring a pro, success starts with smart timing and thorough prep. Here’s how to make sure your exterior painting project stands up to the rain and lasts for years.

    1. Pick Your Weather Window
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Check forecasts carefully—ideally you’ll want at least 2–3 dry days before and after your scheduled painting. The sweet spot in Portland is usually late spring through early fall. Even during dry spells, morning dew can delay your start time each day.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    2. Power Wash and Dry Thoroughly
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Dirt, moss, and mildew are common on Northwest siding. Use a pressure washer or scrub by hand with a mild cleaner. Then, allow 24–48 hours of dry time—any trapped moisture can ruin adhesion and cause blistering.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    3. Inspect for Rot or Damage
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Before you paint, check for soft spots, peeling caulk, and water-stained wood. Address these issues with repairs or replacements now—paint won’t stick to compromised material, and moisture will sneak back in.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    4. Prime Smart, Not Just Fast
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Always prime bare wood and repaired areas before applying topcoat. In wetter climates like Portland, use oil-based or bonding primers that seal well and resist mold growth. Don’t rush this step—it’s your moisture barrier.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    5. Seal and Caulk the Gaps
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Use high-quality, paintable exterior caulk around windows, doors, trim, and siding seams. Seal every crack where water might intrude. For best results, caulk on a dry day and let it cure fully before painting.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Final Word: Prep is Protection
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Painting in Portland’s rainy climate requires patience—but a little planning goes a long way. When you take time to prep properly, you don’t just improve your home’s appearance—you protect it from the elements. And that’s an investment that always pays off.
