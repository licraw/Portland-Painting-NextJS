    Choosing the Right Siding Restoration Services in Portland: What to Look For
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Your siding protects your home from Oregon’s wet winters and UV-filled summers—so when it starts to fail, restoration becomes urgent. But not all siding contractors are created equal. This guide breaks down what Portland homeowners should ask, expect, and avoid when hiring siding restoration services.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Must-Ask Questions for Any Contractor
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>How many homes have you restored in Portland specifically?</li>
    <li>Can you provide local references and before/after photos?</li>
    <li>What siding materials do you specialize in (wood, fiber cement, vinyl)?</li>
    <li>How do you address hidden moisture or rot once siding is removed?</li>
    <li>Will you handle painting or recommend a partner for finishing?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Licensing and Insurance Matter
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Make sure your contractor is licensed with the Oregon Construction Contractors Board (CCB) and carries both liability and workers’ compensation insurance. You can verify licenses at <a href="https://www.ccb.state.or.us/search/" class="underline">ccb.state.or.us</a>. Never hire a contractor who can’t show proof—no matter how affordable the quote.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Red Flags to Avoid
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Quotes that are drastically lower than others</li>
    <li>No written estimate or vague contract terms</li>
    <li>High-pressure sales tactics or “today only” pricing</li>
    <li>Lack of physical business address or online presence</li>
    <li>Reluctance to pull permits (if required)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Material and Method Transparency
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    A reputable contractor will walk you through siding material options, explain the restoration process step-by-step, and set clear expectations for noise, access, and timelines. If they’re rushing or glossing over the details, take that as a warning.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Final Thoughts: Choose With Confidence
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Siding restoration isn’t just cosmetic—it’s about protecting your home’s structure. With the right contractor, you can get both form and function, restoring beauty while defending against the Pacific Northwest’s weather for years to come.
