    Seasonal Maintenance Tips: Protecting Your Wood Decks and Fences in Oregon
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Oregon’s climate—rainy winters, dry summers, and plenty of tree coverage—means your deck and fence are constantly exposed to the elements. Without seasonal care, moisture, sun, and moss can take a toll on even the most well-built wood structures. Here’s how to keep your outdoor spaces protected and looking great all year long.

    Spring: Clean and Inspect
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Start the season with a thorough cleaning. Use a gentle wood cleaner or a diluted oxygen bleach solution to remove grime, moss, and mildew. Inspect for loose boards, popped nails, or early signs of rot. Replace or repair as needed before the summer heat sets in.
  </p>

    Summer: Seal and Protect
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    After spring cleaning and repairs, summer is the best time to seal. Choose a high-quality stain or clear sealant with UV protection. Apply when the wood is dry and weather forecasts are clear. Pay special attention to horizontal surfaces like deck boards and fence caps where water lingers.
  </p>

    Fall: Clear and Prepare
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    As leaves fall, keep your deck and fence clear of debris to avoid staining and moisture retention. This is also a good time to re-check for drainage issues. Trim back plants and ensure water flows away from your deck footings and posts.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Winter: Monitor and Maintain
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Oregon’s winters are wet and unpredictable. Check periodically for standing water, snow buildup, or signs of mold growth. Gently brush off snow rather than using metal tools, and avoid applying salt-based de-icers directly on wood.

    Tips for Long-Term Deck and Fence Health
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Use pressure-treated or rot-resistant wood like cedar or redwood.</li>
    <li>Keep the structure ventilated and free from ground contact where possible.</li>
    <li>Re-seal every 1–2 years depending on sun and rain exposure.</li>
    <li>Schedule annual maintenance around Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Keep It Safe, Keep It Beautiful
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Your deck and fence are outdoor investments—treat them like you would your roof or foundation. A bit of seasonal care goes a long way in preventing costly repairs and preserving the natural beauty of your home’s exterior.
