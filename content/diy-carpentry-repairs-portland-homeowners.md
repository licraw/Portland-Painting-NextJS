    DIY Carpentry Repairs Every Portland Homeowner Should Know
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Living in Portland means embracing character—and that includes the quirks of older homes. While professional contractors are key for big remodels, small issues don’t always require a full-service visit. Here are the top DIY carpentry fixes every Portland homeowner should feel confident handling to keep their home safe, quiet, and looking sharp between renovations.

    1. Fixing a Squeaky Floor or Threshold
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Rain and seasonal changes can cause wood to expand and contract, making floorboards creak. For minor squeaks, sprinkle talcum powder or graphite between the boards to reduce friction. For louder creaks, a few trim screws through the subfloor into the joist can silence the noise without damaging the surface.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    2. Repairing Loose Railing or Handrails
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Wobbly stair railings are a common issue in Portland’s older homes. Tighten any loose screws, or replace missing ones with longer wood screws for better grip. For stripped holes, use wooden dowels and wood glue to fill the gap before reattaching hardware.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    3. Replacing Rotten Trim or Fascia
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    The Pacific Northwest’s moisture can be tough on exterior wood trim. If you notice soft spots, cut out the damaged area and patch with new primed trim. Always paint and caulk immediately to seal out future water damage.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    4. Realigning Sticking Doors
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Humidity can swell doors, making them rub against the jamb. Try tightening hinge screws or replacing them with longer ones. If needed, sand down the high points, then repaint or re-seal to protect exposed wood.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    5. Filling Nail Holes and Small Gaps
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Use wood filler to patch nail holes or dents in trim. For caulk gaps between trim and wall, use paintable latex caulk and a damp finger to smooth the finish before painting. A steady hand can make your trim look freshly installed.
  </p>
