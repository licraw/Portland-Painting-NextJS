  </h1>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Cabinet refinishing is one of the most transformative and cost-effective updates you can make in a Portland kitchen—but should you hire a pro or do it yourself? This guide breaks down the pros, cons, and real-world considerations of each route, from timelines to costs to quality results.

    Cost Comparison: DIY vs. Pro
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li><strong>DIY Cost:</strong> $150–$400 (paint, primer, sandpaper, supplies)</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Cost:</strong> $2,000–$6,000 depending on kitchen size and finish level</li>
    <li><strong>Hidden Costs:</strong> DIY can take longer, require time off work, or lead to mistakes that cost more to fix later</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Time & Labor
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    DIY refinishing typically takes 3–7 days of labor-intensive effort: removing doors, sanding, priming, painting, and curing. Pros can often complete the job in 2–3 days with better tools and fewer disruptions to your kitchen routine.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Finish Quality
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    A professional finish often includes spray equipment, hard-curing topcoats, and controlled environments. DIY finishes tend to rely on brushes and rollers, which can show marks if not applied carefully. However, with patience and prep, DIY can yield great results on a budget.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    When to Go Pro
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Your cabinets have heavy wear, grease buildup, or detailed trim</li>
    <li>You want a sprayed factory finish or custom color-matching</li>
    <li>You need the job done quickly and cleanly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    When DIY Makes Sense
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>You’re on a tight budget and have free weekends to spare</li>
    <li>You enjoy detail work and want a hands-on project</li>
    <li>You don’t mind a less-than-perfect but improved finish</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Bottom Line: Match the Method to Your Needs
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. If your Portland kitchen is in good shape and you have time, DIY may be the way to go. If you want flawless results without the hassle, hiring a pro can save time and stress. Either way, cabinet refinishing is a smart update that brings new life to your space without the cost of full replacement.
