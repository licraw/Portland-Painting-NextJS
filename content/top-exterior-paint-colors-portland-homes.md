    1. Mossy Green and Forest Tones
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Deep greens blend beautifully with Portland’s evergreen landscape. These tones evoke a sense of calm and stability while holding up well against rain and mildew. Ideal for craftsman homes or properties surrounded by dense foliage.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    2. Soft Gray with White Trim
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Classic and modern, soft gray exteriors with crisp white trim are a staple in neighborhoods like Laurelhurst and Sellwood. Acrylic latex-based grays tend to resist moisture well and pair beautifully with metal or natural wood accents.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    3. Earthy Taupe and Warm Beige
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    These neutral tones adapt effortlessly to Portland’s ever-changing skies and work wonderfully on mid-century ranches or contemporary homes. Opt for paint formulas with mold-inhibiting agents to extend longevity.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    4. Slate Blue and Stormy Sky
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Inspired by overcast skies and coastal influence, these blues are moody yet refined. They add personality to traditional and Victorian homes without overwhelming the structure or the landscape.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    5. Muted Terracotta and Rust Red
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    A nod to historic charm, these colors pop against the green surroundings and add character without clashing with nature. They also perform well when treated with high-performance, weather-sealing topcoats.
